This file is an attempt to consolidate available information on setting up, building,
and packaging RomRaider.  All instructions assume the use of Eclipse for development.

----------------------------------------------
Setting up the project (from romraider.com)

As an open source project, RomRaider depends on Java developers like you for 
enhancements, bug fixes and general maintenance. This page is meant to be a 
guide to setting up a development environment from scratch. The guide was 
originally written by Tgui in this thread and has been adapted and revised.

RomRaider’s official IDE is Eclipse. You are free to use any Java IDE you 
choose, but due to the extremely simple process of setting up the environment 
and the power of Eclipse, it’s probably your best choice.

    * Installing Eclipse and Subclipse
          o Install the latest version of the Java Development Kit
          o Get and Install Eclipse for your platform
          o Install Subclipse for Subversion (SVN) integration, following the 
              steps outlined here. 
    * Setting up the RomRaider project
          o Open the Java perspective in Eclipse by clicking 
              Window > Open Perspective > Java
          o Right click in the package explorer and select “Import…”
          o Select “Checkout Projects from SVN” and click “Next”
          o Select “Use a new repository location:” and click “Next”
          o Enter “http://svn.romraider.com/enginuity” and click “Next”
          o Highlight “trunk” in the folder tree and click “Next”
          o Name the project “enginuity” and click “Finish” 

Now all you have to do is add the Jars within your libs dir to the project 
java build path. You should read this.

----------------------------------------------

Notes on the above:  

1)  Make sure the build path for the Java builder is set correctly.  On the top menu:

        Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path

    On the Source tab, the default output folder should be set to

        enginuity/build/classes

2)  The jars in the java build path mentioned above should be correct in the SVN
    repository. 

The ant build file is in the main directory and uses the default name of "build.xml".

The Java builder is set as the default.  During development it's convenient to have
the "Problems" pane show warning and errors.  The ant build does not send warnings
or errors there.  The ant build is primarily for automation of the complete build 
process for packaging.   

To build using ant, right-click on the build
file in the Package Explorer (Java perspective) and select 

Run As -> Ant Build

The "help" target lists available targets with a brief description of each.
