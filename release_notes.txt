                    - RomRaider 0.5.4 Beta RC1 -
            Open-Source ECU Tuning -- www.romraider.com


PLEASE MAKE SURE TO READ RELEASE _NOTES.TXT_ EACH TIME YOU DOWNLOAD
A NEW VERSION OF ROMRAIDER. IMPORTANT NOTICES, KNOWN ISSUES AND
NEW FEATURES WILL BE DISCUSSED.

RomRaider is a full featured Engine Control Unit editing application
for tuning virtually any manufacturer, meant to be used in conjunction
with ECU flash and dump utilities. RomRaider will give you full
control over timing, fuel, boost and many other parameters in your
ECU, competing with very expensive and proprietary software. RomRaider
will remove your need for piggyback systems designed to control these
functions, and, in most cases, work as well as or better than any
stand alone engine management. Reflashing your stock ECU also has the
added benefit of a manufacturer tested base map, giving you top notch
performance and saving time tuning idle and low throttle applications
while retaining all of the benefit of the research and development
manufacturer's spend millions of dollars on.

RomRaider is currently in BETA TEST status, meaning it is not
thoroughly tested and not intended for use by inexperienced users. In
addition to being incomplete and untested, only experienced tuners
with the required tools (ie, wideband oxygen sensor) should modify an
ECU image. As with any engine management, changes could result in
severe engine damage. Use at your own risk.

Documentation is available at http://wiki.romraider.com and the
official RomRaider FAQ can be found at
http://www.romraider.com/about444.html. Please be aware that as
RomRaider is still in beta status and changing frequently,
documentation may be incomplete or out of date.

---------------------------
- Editor
  - Pasting table data can cause hangs under certain circumstances
- Logger
  - Gauge min/max/step limits incomplete in logger.xml and External plug-ins

- Change Log -
--------------

0.5.4b RC1 (??/??/????)
-----------------------

--- Logger ---
- TXS Tuner Wideband plugin added courtesy of, nitros
- Added support for ECU/TCU Switch filtering
- Added (msec) designation to logged CSV column heading
- Added support for sorting the Selected? & Description parameter list entries.
- Added support for convertors on External data items (F/C, lambda/AFR, etc.)
- Added all defined PLX Sensors according to their documentation
- Added more Innovate MTS LM-2 support for additional sensors.  Sensors are now
  loaded dynamically when the Logger starts.  Sensor units are set via LogWorks.
- Updated library COM4J to version: com4j-20110322. This affects Innovate MTS
  and Tactrix Openport 2.0 support.
--- Editor ---
- Fixed JInternalFrame.isPalette in TableFarme so table titles are visible on
  Mac OS.
  

0.5.3b RC10 (09/12/2011)
------------------------

--- Editor ---
- Added support for multiple-state switches.  Switch Tables will now use
  Radio Buttons rather than a Checkbox.
- Added ECU definition data validation for Switch Tables.  If the ROM image data
  does not match one of the switch states according to the definition then a
  warning is presented and the table is locked from editing.
- Added ROM Checksum validation on image open for 32 bit ROMs.  An ERROR message
  is presented warning not to use the ROM image as it may be corrupt.
- Added ROM Checksum calculation for 32 bit ROMs.  Upon file save the new
  Checksums (if not previously disabled) are written to the ROM.
- Added a ROM Edit Stamp to 32 bit ROMs consisting of the YYMMDD and an
  incremental count value.  This Edit Stamp is displayed in the View->ROM
  properties menu item.
- Fixed the missing Table Tree problem when running RomRaider on systems
  using IcedTea or OpenJDK JVM.
--- Logger ---
- Added more selections to the Right-click menu associated with the LogFile text
  field.

This RC includes the new Road Dyno/ET tab, version 16.
To use the Road Dyno:
	- Set the Mode button to Dyno
	- Clear all parameters from the other tabs to achieve the best data
	  resolution.
	- On the Dyno tab, select your vehicle and adjust the tire size and
	  gear you will be using.
	- Once set, press the Record Data button.
	- With the button pressed setup to do your WOT run, no need to hurry.
	- Hold WOT run to redline.  As soon as WOT is no longer detected the
	  graph will be updated with your estimated wheel power and torque.
	- Adjust temperature and humidity if they are not accurate and
	  "recalculate" the results.
	- Smoothing, lower is more smooth and higher is less smooth.
	- Right click on the graph to Save as...
	- If you wish to average two or more consecutive runs, press the
	  Record Data button again and repeat the WOT run.  At the end of
	  each run the datasets will be combined and the results displayed.
	- A Reference Trace can be Saved and displayed at any time for comparison.
	- The Clear button will delete all recorded data for a fresh start.

To use the ET feature:
	- Set the Mode button to ET
	- Clear all parameters from the other tabs to achieve the best data
	  resolution.
	- On the Dyno tab, select the vehicle you will be using.
	- Once set and the vehicle is stationary, SPEED = 0, press the Record ET button.
	- With the button pressed complete your 1/4 mile run.
	- As soon as 1/4 mile distance is covered the graph will be updated with
	  your elapsed times and speeds.
	- Right click on the graph to Save as...
	- Or Save a Reference Trace of your times to a text file.
